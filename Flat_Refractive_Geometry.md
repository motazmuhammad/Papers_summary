Summary of the abstract according to my understanding.

This paper charchterizes the behaviour of underwater cameras to reduce the error found in them by employing a calibration. According to the paper
the main problem is due to the assumption that cameras deploy an SVP model which is an invalid assumption for the case of underwater imaging.
